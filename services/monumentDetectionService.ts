3. Historical period, creation dates, or artist information
4. Brief description (2-3 sentences) including artistic style, medium, or architectural features
5. Historical, artistic, or cultural significance (2-3 sentences)
6. 3-4 interesting facts about the piece, artist, or historical context
7. Confidence level (0-100) - be more selective, only use high confidence (80+) if you're very sure

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- Only mark isRecognized as true if you have high confidence (80+) in the identification
- Always provide the ACTUAL location of the artwork/monument you identify, not just the user's provided location
- If the user provided location context helps you identify a local artwork or monument, use that information but still verify and provide the correct location
- Be more selective - it's better to say "Unknown Artwork" than to incorrectly identify something
- Consider various art forms: sculptures, paintings, frescoes, mosaics, architectural details, monuments, etc.
- If you see artistic or architectural elements but can't confidently identify a specific piece, describe what you see with lower confidence
